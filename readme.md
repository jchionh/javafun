## javafun

This is a program just for fun, that summarizes the hilarious encouters that I have experienced while programming in the Java world.

Generally, objects get new'd everywhere even when there is no necessity.

Factories and helpers appear very often, adding complexity and layers to the code where in many cases is unnecessary.

Simply doing a direct computation will suffice.
