This is a program just for fun, that summarizes the hilarious encouters that I have experienced while programming in the Java world.

A general observation is that the language is verbose, and objects get new'd everywhere even when there is no necessity.

Also factories and abstact helpers appear very often, adding complexity and layers to the code where in many cases is unnecessary and just simply doing a direct computation will suffice.
